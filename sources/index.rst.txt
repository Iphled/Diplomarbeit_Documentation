Welcome to the PetriLyzer, a tool which allows you to classify and certify Petri nets according to their trace similarity.

Requirements
============

The project was tested using Python 3.12 on Ubuntu.
Running it with a different interpreter or operating system might result into a divergent outcome.

For additional package needs, please consult the requirements.txt.

Usage
=====

To use the PetriLyzer tool, please perform the following steps:

* Set up the project
* Run the project

Classification:

* Load a Petri net via "Petri Net/Open"
* Select your classification aim via "Classify/Classification Goal"
* Run the classification via "Classify/Run..."
* You can now display the explanation or save the classification

Certification

* Optional: Load a Petri net and run the classification
* Create or load a certification metric
* Local Certification: Look, whether your loaded Petri net and classification lies within the certificate
* Global Certification: Check the classification model against the certification metric

Data Types
==========

Please load the Petri net using the .pnml format.

The certification metrics have a file format called .cert which is based on the .pickle format.

A GDL program for the certificate precondition should have the following format:

node
edge
target graph
